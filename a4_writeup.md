# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
        The most difficult part was understanding what to write where.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
        I would a random number generator from 0-8 and use that input.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
        I would make the computer check if there is any open spaces that result in a win, if the computer finds the player can get a win it will instead block it. Should it have to make a decision between 2 answers I will make it flip a coin and take that option.
